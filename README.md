# DungeonBuilder Custom Art Definitions Patcher

Enhance your Dungeon Builder experience with custom art by using this Art Definitions Patcher. This tool streamlines the creation of the Artdefinition file for your personalized artwork in Dungeon Builder.

## How to use

### 1. Create a custom folder for your Art:
    
    \Custom\Art\decorate\hobbyte\customFolder\

### 2. Place your custom Art there
Copy your .png files into the folder (Note: Currently, only .png files are supported by this patcher). \
Be cautious with special characters like "äöüß"; the patcher will warn you if it detects any.
### 3. Run the DungeonPatcher.exe

    .\DungeonPatcher.exe \fullpathTo..\Custom\Art\decorate\hobbyte\customFolder\ 

### 4. Done!
The Patcher created a Art Definitions File as so..

    \Custom\Art Definitions\decorate\hobbyte\customFolder.xml


## Configure

Customize the artist information that is written into the Artdefinitions file through the Configfile:

    \config\ArtistInfo.xml
